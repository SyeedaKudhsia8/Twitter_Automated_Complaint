# Twitter Automated Complaint Bot

There are many issues that people face and complain via customer service or on twitter and get fair actions done from the respective companies. But going on a social media platform and complaining must be tiering for some people like me. 

## Using Selenium
1. First getting hold of the wifi data - download speed and upload speed.
2. Logining into the twitter account with personal credentials
3. Writing tweet about the current speed
